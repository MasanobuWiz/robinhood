                summary: "AMC Entertainment Inc (NYSE: AMC ) became the top holding in Millennial and Gen Z accounts in the second quarter, up from sixth place in the first quarter according to Apex Clearing. AMC is also the top holding in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE: IWM ) at 0.78%. The stock has, so far, struggled to rebound back toward its June 2 high of $72.62, which could be partly due to the Russell 2000 being unable to make a new all-time high. Unlike the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY ) and the Nasdaq, which both reached new all-time highs on Monday, the Russell 2000 has lagged its counterparts by failing to break above $234.53 and get a blue sky run. On Monday AMC was trading up over 6% but struggled at a resistance level near the $40 mark. The stock is currently in a daily uptrend and needs to clear $46.55 to put in its next higher high. Options traders believe AMC will jump above the resistance level in the coming weeks and months with a few even betting AMC could reach $100 or higher by December. Together the traders purchased well over $3.16 million worth of bullish call contracts.",

                summary: "Key Events This Very Busy Week: Fed, GDP, Earnings Gallore And Much More Cutting to the chase, its a very busy week, perhaps the most important week for markets this summer. Clearly the Federal Reserves decision on Wednesday is likely to be the focal point. As well as that, there are a number of key data releases, including the first look at Q2s GDP reading for the US (Thursday) and the Euro Area (Friday), whilst earnings reports will include Tesla (today), Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft (all tomorrow), and Facebook (Wednesday). So get ready for a barrage of early week tech earnings after a good start to the US season. Looking at some of the highlights in more detail lets start with the Fed. As DB''s Jim Reid writes, at last meeting in June the FOMC undertook a hawkish shift by moving their median dot to show two rate hikes in 2023, compared to none before. Meanwhile inflation data has continued to surprise to the upside since then, with the latest CPI reading at +5.4%, and core CPI at +4.5%, which is the highest for the latter since 1991.",

            Between greater smartphone penetration in emerging markets and repeat sales to current 
            customers, Apple has plenty of opportunity to reap the rewards of its iPhone business.

            Apple's iPhone and iOS operating system have consistently been rated at the head of 
            the pack in terms of customer loyalty, engagement, and security, which bodes well for long-term customer retention.

            We think Apple is still innovating with introductions of Apple Pay, Apple Watch, 
            Apple TV, and AirPods; each of these could drive incremental revenue, but more crucially help to retain iPhone users over time.

            bearsSay: `
            Appleâ€™s decisions to maintain a premium pricing strategy may help fend off gross 
            margin compression but could limit unit sales growth, as devices may be unaffordable for many customers.

            If Apple were to ever launch a buggy software update or subpar services, it could 
            diminish the firm's reputation for building products that "just work."

            Apple is believed to be behind firms like Google and Amazon in artificial intelligence, 
            or AI, development (notably Siri voice recognition), which could be problematic as tech 
            firms look to integrate AI in order to deliver premium services to customers.

            Tesla has the potential to disrupt the automotive and 
            power generation industries with its technology for EVs, 
            AVs, batteries, and solar generation systems.

            Tesla will see higher profit margins as the company achieves its plan to
            reduce battery costs by 56% over the next several years.

            Through the combination of its industry-leading technology and unique 
            Supercharger network, Tesla offers the best function of any EV on the market, 
            which will result in the company maintaining its market leader status as EV adoption increases.

            bearsSay: `
            Traditional automakers are investing heavily in the development of 
            electric vehicles, which will result in Tesla losing market share and seeing 
            a deceleration in sales growth due to increased competition.

            EV adoption is driven largely by government initiatives, such as regulations and subsidies, 
            which will limit long-term market growth for Tesla.

            Solar panel and battery prices will decline faster than Tesla can reduce costs, 
            resulting in little to no profits for the energy generation and storage business
